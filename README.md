# SimpleDL

## Introduction

You can check the `task 1` and `task 2` in the corresponding folder. And for `task 2`, due to this task is not so complex, I just write the code in the [independent_class.ipynb](/task2/independent_class.ipynb).

## Install
If you would like to run the `task 2`, you can use:
```bash
conda create -n simpledl python=3.8
conda activate simpledl
cd task2
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
